## Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python
In this project, I undertook the task of analyzing social media data by generating, cleaning, visualizing, and performing statistical analysis on a dataset of tweets. Here's a summary of the process and key findings:

##### Data Generation and Cleaning:
* Data Generation: I created a synthetic dataset consisting of random dates, categories, and numbers of likes to simulate real-world social media data.
* Data Cleaning: I handled missing values and duplicates to ensure the integrity of the data. By converting date and likes fields to appropriate formats, I prepared the data for effective analysis.

##### Data Visualization:
* Histogram: The histogram of likes showed the distribution of likes across the dataset. The presence of a bell-shaped curve indicated that most tweets received a moderate number of likes, with fewer tweets receiving very high or very low likes.
* Boxplot: The boxplot visualized the distribution of likes across different categories. It revealed variations in likes among categories, with some categories having higher median likes and larger interquartile ranges.

##### Statistical Analysis:
* Overall Mean of Likes: The mean number of likes across all tweets was approximately 4987, indicating a generally moderate level of engagement.
* Mean Likes by Category: Analysis by category showed differences in engagement levels, with categories like 'Culture' and 'Health' having higher average likes compared to others. This suggests that certain topics resonate more with the audience, which can guide content strategies.

##### Challenges and Solutions
* Handling Missing Values: One challenge was dealing with missing values in the dataset. I addressed this by removing rows with null values to maintain the dataset's quality.
* Ensuring Data Integrity: Removing duplicates was crucial to avoid skewed results. I used built-in Pandas methods to ensure that the dataset was clean and reliable.
* Data Conversion: Converting fields to appropriate data types was necessary for accurate analysis and visualization. I ensured the 'Date' field was in datetime format and 'Likes' was an integer.

#### Unique Aspects of the Project
* Synthetic Data Generation: The use of synthetic data allowed for the demonstration of the entire data analysis pipeline without relying on real-world datasets, showcasing the ability to handle various data scenarios.
* Comprehensive Analysis: The combination of visualization and statistical analysis provided a thorough understanding of the data. The use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, along with Pandas for statistical analysis, demonstrated proficiency with essential data analysis tools.
